Investments that require hundreds of millions of dollars can only be accessed by billionaires, and even those with high net worth are unable to access these opportunities. We are removing these barriers by allowing for fractional ownership of assets through crowdfunding methods.',
    'tab-desc-2' => 'Blockchain technology allows us to be able to manage fractional ownership opportunities in several ways. First, open ledgers allow for all transactions to be open and honest, allowing for all investors to be aware of exactly what they are receiving and that no money goes unaccounted for. Second, smart contracts allow for the management and execution of the will of all owners in a quick and efficient manner, speeding up the process of a traditional shareholders meeting. Third, blockchain governance allows for users to make decisions regarding their assets in a fair and open environment, regardless of where they are in the world.',
    'tab-desc-3' => 'Many financial and technology institutions begin their projects with the best intentions of mind without looking into future potential legal ramifications for their projects or how current laws can bottleneck their development. We take the law seriously and it is even a necessary element to our business. Progress in current law is a key element to adapting new technology in society, and we actively find the best ways to be compliant as well as fill in the gaps where no law exists.',
